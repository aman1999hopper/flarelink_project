# flarelink_project

>> This project is a Task Management Application built with React and JavaScript, and styled with Tailwind CSS. The app allows users to add, delete, and manage tasks. Users can assign priority levels, mark tasks as complete, search for specific tasks, and sort tasks by various criteria. Tasks persist between sessions using local storage, so data remains available even after refreshing the page.

** Add Task: Input a task with a title and add it to the task list.
** Delete Task: Remove a task from the list permanently.
** Mark as Complete: Toggle a task's completion status.
** Search Tasks: Use the search bar to find specific tasks by title.
** Task Priority: Assign priority levels (Low, Medium, High) to each task.
** Sort Tasks: Sort tasks by title, priority, or creation date.
** Local Storage Persistence: Task data is saved in local storage to keep data persistent across sessions.
